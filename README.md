# Sclp Compiler
Step-by-Step construction of a Compiler. This was part of our Compilers Lab course (CS316).

## Reference Material  
For an high level overview read [this](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~uday/sclp-web/)

## Highlights of Work done  
- Created a C-like compiler from scratch using lex and yacc
- Implemented the scanning, parsing, Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), Three Address Code (TAC) and Register Transfer Language (RTL) stages for input programs with visibility of output of each intermediate stage
- Input programs had assignments, functions, complex expressions and control flow structures
- Ensured illegal tokens, syntax errors, semantic errors are reported

## Code will be added in some time
